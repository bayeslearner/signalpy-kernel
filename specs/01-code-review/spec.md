# Code Review: Bayeslearner Microkernel

<!-- The YAML above is the single source of truth for status and
     relationships. Never edit it outside /spec-plan or /spec-link. -->

## Context

Thorough code review of the microkernel framework for agentic-era development.
This is intended to be a **source-embeddable package** — copied into other
projects as a foundation. The review evaluates architecture soundness,
code quality, package readiness, docs accuracy, and suitability for the
stated goal: a kernel small enough for AI agents to read in one pass and
immediately write correct components for.

**Codebase stats:** 2532 lines across 20 Python files. 10 components boot
successfully. Example runs end-to-end demonstrating bus invocation, API
gateway surface composition, transport rendering (REST/MCP/CLI), internal
runnable exclusion, and lifecycle management.

## Constraints

- Must remain embeddable (source copy, not pip install — though pip should also work)
- Python 3.10+ (uses `X | Y` union syntax)
- Zero required deps for kernel/ (Axis 1). Optional deps for platform/ and adapters/
- Must stay under ~1500 lines for Axis 1 (constitution C9)

## Decisions

### D1: Architecture is fundamentally sound
**Choice:** The two-axis model (mechanism vs vocabulary), constitution, decorator-based
component model, runtime scoping, and gateway pattern are all strong foundations.
**Why:** The separation is clean: kernel (~650 LOC) orchestrates; everything else is
components. The decorator API (`@component`, `@provides`, `@requires`, `@runnable`, `@api`)
is intuitive and composable. The gateway pattern (components declare → gateway composes →
adapters render) is the right abstraction. The bus (invoke + pub/sub with pluggable transport)
is simple and correct. The structural scoping for credentials and storage enforces per-component
isolation without configuration.

### D2: Trait system is aspirational, not implemented
**Choice:** Acknowledge that the trait system (L0-L3) is currently documentation/metadata only.
**Why:** `TraitRegistry` is instantiated and populated with L0 trait names at boot, but never
queried during activation, service resolution, or runtime building. The `applicator` field on
`TraitDef` is never called. No code path reads from the trait registry to make decisions.
The traits described in `docs/traits.html` (application order, L1 auto-injection, L2
contribution) do not match how the code actually works. The kernel works entirely through
`ComponentMeta` (provides/requires/runnables/apis) — the trait system is a parallel vocabulary
that doesn't participate in execution.

### D3: `platform/` module name must change
**Choice:** Rename `platform/` to avoid shadowing Python's stdlib `platform` module.
**Why:** `import platform` is a stdlib module. Having a directory named `platform/` causes
import collisions depending on `sys.path` order. This is a blocking issue for source embedding.

### D4: Entry points have stale imports
**Choice:** Fix immediately — these are broken code.
**Why:** `entries/fastapi_entry.py` imports `RESTAdapter` (should be `RESTTransport`).
`entries/cli_entry.py` imports `CLIAdapter` (should be `CLITransport`). Neither entry
point currently runs.

## Tasks

### P1 — Must Do (blocking for package use)

- [x] 1.1 Fix `platform/` module name — renamed to `providers/`
  - Shadows Python stdlib `platform` module
  - Updated all imports across the codebase

- [x] 1.2 Fix stale imports in entries/
  - `entries/fastapi_entry.py` — `RESTAdapter` → `RESTTransport`, added missing `APIGateway`
  - `entries/cli_entry.py` — `CLIAdapter` → `CLITransport`, added missing `APIGateway`

- [x] 1.3 Remove `sys.path.insert(0, ".")` hacks
  - Removed from `example.py`, `entries/fastapi_entry.py`, `entries/cli_entry.py`

- [x] 1.4 Add `pyproject.toml` with package metadata
  - Optional dependency groups: `[providers]`, `[rest]`, `[cli]`, `[tracing]`, `[dev]`, `[all]`

- [x] 1.5 Fix path traversal vulnerability in StorageProvider
  - Added `_safe_path()` method: resolves paths and rejects traversal via `is_relative_to()`

- [x] 1.6 Fix REST error handler leaking internal details
  - 500 responses now return generic "Internal server error", details logged server-side

- [x] 1.7 Add params validation against `params_model`
  - Bus handler closures now validate via `model_validate()` when Pydantic model available

### P2 — Should Do (correctness and consistency)

- [x] 2.1 Fix `_make_handler` closure — removed unnecessary `async def`
  - Changed to plain `def _make_handler(...)` returning an async handler

- [x] 2.2 Fix `queue.pop(0)` O(n) in toposort
  - Uses `collections.deque.popleft()` now

- [x] 2.3 Add scoped logging wrapper (like credentials/storage)
  - Kernel now calls `service.get_logger(name, factory)` for ILogger contracts
  - Components receive a scoped `ComponentLogger` instead of raw `LoggingProvider`

- [x] 2.4 Document the two-phase boot clearly
  - Enhanced inline comments explaining WHY two phases are needed

- [-] 2.5 Add `kernel/__init__.py` exports for `contracts` module DROPPED: 2.0 re-exports contracts from its own package; 1.0 shipped 0.4.0 without it
  - `IConfig`, `IStorage`, etc. should be importable from `kernel.contracts`
  - Currently they're importable but not re-exported from `kernel`

- [-] 2.6 Consider caching the runtime per component instance DROPPED: never measured as a cost; 2.0 has no per-component runtime
  - `_build_runtime()` runs on every bus invocation (line 222-223)
  - For read-only runtimes, cache and invalidate on service changes

### P3 — Nice to Have

- [-] 3.1 Wire up the trait system to actually participate in activation DROPPED: 2.0 deletes the trait system — it was inspection, not behaviour
  - Make `TraitRegistry` query-able during activation
  - Use trait applicators to auto-inject services based on trait membership
  - This is the big architectural investment — currently traits are metadata only

- [-] 3.2 Add a test harness component DROPPED: 2.0 tests plugins directly; a harness component has no consumer
  - A `TestEntry` that boots the kernel with in-memory everything
  - Makes it easy for embedders to test their components

- [-] 3.3 Add `__all__` to all modules DROPPED: cosmetic, and 1.0 is in maintenance now that 2.0 carries the direction
  - Controls public API surface for IDE autocompletion and documentation

- [-] 3.4 Add type annotations to `activate(self, rt)` signatures DROPPED: 2.0 has no activate(self, rt); the POPO constructor is the typed surface
  - All platform/adapter components use untyped `rt` parameter
  - Use `Runtime` type for IDE support

## Open Questions

- [x] Is the architecture fundamentally sound? — Yes, the two-axis model, constitution,
  and component patterns are well-designed. See D1.
- [-] Should the trait system be wired up now or deferred? DROPPED: answered by 2.0 — deleted. — It's the biggest gap between
  docs and code. Wiring it up would fulfill the architecture vision but adds complexity.
  Deferring keeps the kernel simpler but means docs describe a system that doesn't exist.
- [-] Should `kernel/contracts.py` ship with Axis 1 or Axis 2? DROPPED: answered by 2.0 — there is no Axis 1/2 split. — Contracts are "vocabulary"
  (Axis 2 by the doc's own definition) but ship in `kernel/`. The README says they ship
  with the kernel "so there's a common language." This is pragmatic but blurs the axis boundary.
- [-] DROPPED: answered by 2.0 — these are ordinary plugins, not a platform tier. Missing components from the architecture: `AuthProvider`, `WorkspaceProvider`,
  `RemoteAdapter`, `GRPCAdapter`, `ClientGen` — are these planned or aspirational?

## Log

**2026-04-22** — Initial deep code review. Codebase is 2532 lines, 20 Python files.
10 components boot successfully with example.py. Architecture is sound; main issues
are (1) trait system is docs-only, (2) `platform/` name collides with stdlib,
(3) entry points have stale imports, (4) security issues in storage and REST error
handling, (5) docs describe features that don't exist in code (TraitApplicator,
auth.py, workspace.py, remote.py, GRPCAdapter, etc.). See Decisions D1-D4.

**2026-04-22** — Fixed all P1 and most P2 issues for v0 commit:
- Renamed `platform/` → `providers/` (stdlib collision)
- Fixed stale imports in entries/ (`RESTAdapter`→`RESTTransport`, `CLIAdapter`→`CLITransport`),
  added missing `APIGateway` imports
- Removed `sys.path.insert(0, ".")` from example.py and both entry points
- Added `pyproject.toml` with optional dependency groups
- Fixed path traversal in `StorageProvider` via `_safe_path()` + `is_relative_to()`
- Fixed REST 500 error leaking `str(exc)` — now returns generic message, logs detail
- Added params validation in bus handler closures via `model_validate()`
- Fixed `async def _make_handler` → plain `def` (P2.1)
- Fixed `queue.pop(0)` → `deque.popleft()` in toposort (P2.2)
- Added scoped logger injection for ILogger contracts (P2.3)
- Enhanced two-phase boot documentation (P2.4)
- Updated README and spec. Example still boots 10 components successfully.

## Disposition (2026-08-23)

CLOSED / RETRACTED. Twelve of twenty-one tasks landed and shipped as
`signalpy-kernel` 0.4.0. The remaining nine were 1.0 polish whose direction the
2.0 sprint (`03-plugkit-kernel`) reversed rather than continued — the trait
system it wanted to wire up is deleted in 2.0, and the Axis 1 / Axis 2 platform
split it assumed does not exist there. Each is marked `[-] DROPPED` on the item
with its reason. No successor: 1.0 stays as shipped, in maintenance.

This spec sat ACTIVE from 2026-04-22 to 2026-08-23 while `02` was worked and
closed on top of it — a violation of the activation gate that this closeout
settles.
