"""Tier 2 — the paper's Section 4 operational semantics, checked against the
real cordis runtime.

How to read a rule
==================

Section 4 of the paper specifies a plugin's life as ten *inference rules*.
A rule looks like

    O-Remove:   θn = Inactive(-)   ∀m. πm ≠ n
                -------------------------------
                γ  ⇒  γ ∖ n

Everything above the line is a *premise* ("this is when the rule applies"),
the part below is the *conclusion* ("this is what happens").  `n` is a
fiber — one running copy of a plugin — and `γ` is the whole system state.
Each test below builds the premises on purpose and asserts the conclusion.

The ten rules, in plain words
=============================

- **O-Insert** — the orchestrator asks for a plugin to exist.  It appears
  in a dormant state (`Inactive`), parked under its parent.
- **O-Retire** — the orchestrator asks for it to go away.  Retirement is a
  *request*: the lifecycle rules carry it out.
- **O-Remove** — a fully retired-and-unloaded fiber is dropped from the
  registry.  Its name may then be reused.
- **L-Begin** — a dormant fiber whose declared dependencies are all present
  starts *loading*: it runs its plugin body.
- **L-Iter** — a loading fiber that performs several changes step by step
  accumulates one undo button per step.
- **L-Finish** — the body completes; the fiber becomes *active* and its
  provisions become visible to others.
- **L-Divert** — while loading, the ground shifts under the fiber (a
  dependency changed); it must back out — applying the undo buttons
  collected so far — and never reach active.
- **L-Raise** — the body *fails*; the fiber still backs out cleanly and
  records the error (`Failed` = `Inactive(ξ)`), leaving nothing installed.
- **L-Leave** — an active fiber whose ground shifted is marked *unloading*
  immediately: it stops counting as a provider before anything is undone,
  so its dependents notice and start their own teardown first.
- **L-Unload** — an unloading fiber whose dependents are all gone applies
  its accumulated undo (the guard `¬relied`).

Two tests are marked `xfail(strict=True)`: they assert the *paper's* reading
of L-Begin and the L-Unload guard, which the shipped runtime (JS and this
port alike) does not implement — see README "Faithfulness notes".  If one of
them ever XPASSes, the runtime was aligned with the paper: update the note.
