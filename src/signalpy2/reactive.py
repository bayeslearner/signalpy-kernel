"""Reactive state as a Cordis plugin — the one thing 1.0 had that Cordis lacks.

Cordis reloads a whole plugin when a *provider* changes identity (the epoch in
`fiber.py:_refresh`). That is the right granularity for "the database service was
replaced" and the wrong one for "a config value changed" — reloading a plugin to
observe a new timeout is a sledgehammer, and it is why 1.0 grew Signals.

The two compose rather than compete: a `Computed` or `Effect` created through
this service is registered as a fiber effect, so it is disposed when the plugin
that made it unloads. Nothing leaks, and nothing has to be torn down by hand.

    class Timeouts(Service):
        provide = "timeouts"
        def __cordis_init__(self):
            self.value = self.ctx.reactive.signal(30)

    def http(ctx, config=None):
        # re-runs on every change to the signal, disposed with this plugin
        ctx.reactive.effect(lambda: ctx.client.set_timeout(ctx.timeouts.value.get()))
    http.inject = ["timeouts", "client", "reactive"]

`signal()` is deliberately not an effect: a Signal is state, not a registration,
and it belongs to whoever holds it.
