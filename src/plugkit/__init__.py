"""plugkit — a plugin kernel for Python.

**Every registration returns its undo, and something owns it.**

A component adds a route to a shared server, then unloads. The route stays,
because nothing recorded who added it. That is not a missing feature, it is a
missing invariant. Here the fiber — the object representing a plugin's lifetime —
holds every disposer that plugin produced, and calls them on unload. Hot reload,
dependency-driven activation, and safe implementation swapping are consequences
of that rather than separate features.

Your components stay plain objects. The class below imports nothing from here:

    # services/greeter.py
    class Greeter:
        def __init__(self, database, prefix="hello"):
            self.database = database
            self.prefix = prefix

        def hello(self, name):
            return f"{self.prefix} {name}"

    # app.py — the only file that knows a kernel exists
    from plugkit import Context, provide

    async def main():
        root = Context()
        await root.plugin(provide(Database, "database"))
        await root.plugin(provide(Greeter, "greeter", needs=["database"]))
        print(root.greeter.hello("world"))

`Service` (exported below) is for plugins that *are* kernel surface — the shipped
`ConfigService`, `ToolsService` and friends. Your own code wants `provide()`.

The kernel is a port of Cordis, the plugin framework underneath DeepSeek Harness,
so dsh's documentation stays a working specification for anything built here. See
`VENDORED.md` for which port, why, and what changed in it.

Replaces `signalpy-kernel` 0.4.0, which is retired.
