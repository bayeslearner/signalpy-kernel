"""The docs are checked against the code.

`test_readme_examples.py` and `test_guide_examples.py` run what the docs show, so
a documented API that does not exist fails the suite. That leaves everything about
a doc that is not runnable code: counts, paths, links, and whether the snippet on
the page is complete enough to copy.

Those rotted. The conformance-assertion count was stated in five files and wrong in
five, because a number in prose has nothing holding it to the code. This file is
what holds it.

Two doc sets, deliberately different:

- **CURRENT** — README, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG, the guide, design and steering docs.
  These say what is true *now*, so a stale number in one is a defect.
- **ARCHIVAL** — `specs/` and `docs/history/`. These say what was true on a date.
  A closed spec recording "32 tests across R1-R6" is a record, not a claim about
  today, so counts there are not policed. Links and paths still are: a record that
  points at a file nobody can open has stopped being a record.
