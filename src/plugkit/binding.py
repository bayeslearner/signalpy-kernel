"""Bindings — how a plain class becomes a service without importing the kernel.

The complaint this answers: in 1.0 a component was a class covered in
`@component`, `@provides`, `@requires` decorators, so it imported the kernel and
stopped being a plain object. Cordis is no better on this axis — `class Foo(Service)`
is a base class, and `def apply(ctx, config)` takes a kernel-shaped argument.

So the component and its registration are split. The component is a plain class
that knows nothing about any of this:

    # services/greeter.py — imports nothing from plugkit
    class Greeter:
        def __init__(self, db, prefix="hello"):
            self.db = db
            self.prefix = prefix
        def hello(self, name):
            return f"{self.prefix} {name}"
        def close(self):
            self.db = None

and one line elsewhere says how to wire it:

    # app.py — the only kernel-aware file
    from plugkit import provide
    from services.greeter import Greeter

    greeter = provide(Greeter, "greeter", needs=["db"], config={"prefix": "greeter.prefix"})
    await root.plugin(greeter)

`Greeter` stays constructible in a test as `Greeter(db=FakeDB(), prefix="hi")`,
with no kernel, no container, no fixtures.

## Declaring what you need, once

`needs` takes a list, a dict, or — best — a Protocol:

    class GreeterDeps(Protocol):
        db: Database
        cache: Cache

    provide(Greeter, "greeter", needs=GreeterDeps)

`typing.get_protocol_members` (Python 3.13+) reads the member names off the
Protocol, so the same declaration drives the runtime injection *and* the type
checker. Annotate the constructor with the same types and pyright checks the
component against exactly what the kernel will hand it. One source of truth.

## Config

`config={"prefix": "greeter.prefix"}` reads `ctx.config.get("greeter.prefix")`.
Use a `(key, default)` tuple to supply a default. If `ReactiveService` is
mounted, a change to any of those keys restarts the binding's fiber, which
disposes the old object and constructs a new one from the new values — the
Cordis-correct outcome, since a constructor argument cannot be changed in place.

## Teardown

On unload the binding calls `close()` or `aclose()` if the object has one, or
`__exit__`/`__aexit__` if it is a context manager. Name a different method with
`close="shutdown"`, or pass `close=False` to disable.

    Cordis's own idiom is `fn.inject = [...]`, which works at runtime and is
    rejected by pyright — you cannot assign arbitrary attributes to a function.
    So this returns a plugin mapping instead, which typechecks and which the
    registry already understands.

    With no `inject`, the list is read off the annotation of the first
    parameter, if that annotation is a Protocol:

        class ReportDeps(Protocol):

    **The service name is required, deliberately.** Everything in this kernel is
    looked up by string name, so the name *is* the component's public interface.
    An earlier version defaulted it to `snake_case(factory.__name__)`, which made
    two things go wrong at once:

    - It read like type-based injection. It is not — `needs=["database"]` means
      "the service named `database`", and the class is never consulted. It only
      appeared to work because `Database` snake_cases to `database`.
    - Renaming the class silently broke the wiring. `Database` → `PostgresDatabase`
      changes the service name to `postgres_database`, so every dependent stops
      activating, with no error, because a plugin waiting on a service that never
      arrives is indistinguishable from one that is not needed yet.

    Naming it yourself also pushes you toward the *role* rather than the
    implementation, which is what makes swapping implementations possible:
    `provide(PostgresDatabase, "database")` today, `provide(SqliteDatabase,
    "database")` tomorrow, and no dependent changes.

    Args:
        factory: the component — a plain class or any callable. Never sees `ctx`.
        service_name: the name to register under. Other plugins ask for this string.
        needs: services to pass to the constructor. List, dict, Protocol, or str.
            A list means "the kwarg and the service share a name"; use a dict
            (`{"db": "database"}`) when they differ.
        config: constructor kwargs read from `ctx.config`, as `{kwarg: key}` or
            `{kwarg: (key, default)}`.
        close: teardown method name, or False to skip. Auto-detected by default.
        name: plugin name shown in fiber diagnostics. Defaults to `service_name`.
