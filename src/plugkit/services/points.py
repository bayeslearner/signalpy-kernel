"""Extension points — many plugins filling one named role.

The kernel gives you one half of this already. `ctx.on(name, listener)` is a
named role that any number of plugins contribute to, each contribution owned by
the contributing fiber, and the five dispatch modes run them. What it does not
give you is the ability to *read* the contributions: `_hooks` is private, the
chain is anonymous, and a consumer cannot be woken when the set changes.

So every registry writes those four things itself. In DeepSeek Harness eleven
packages define their own `register()`; in this project `services/tools.py` did
it three times in one file. The shape is always the same:

    def register(self, thing):
        collection = self._collection
        def execute():
            collection.append(thing)
            return lambda: collection.remove(thing)
        return self.ctx.effect(execute, "label")

This service is that shape, once.

    def admin(ctx, config=None):
        ctx.points.add("http.routes", handler, key="/admin", order=10)

    admin.inject = ["points"]

`add` returns a disposer registered against **`admin`'s** fiber, not this
service's, so unloading `admin` removes the route. The caller writes no teardown.

A point is never declared. It exists when something is contributed to it, and
stops existing when the last contribution goes.
